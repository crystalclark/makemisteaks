    "Python is an object oriented computer program language that was originally developed as a learning language by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991. It is named after the british comedy phenomenom \"Monty Python\". It is know for simple clearness of its construct and has become one of the most popular languages in the last decade. A few differences to point out about the language is the fact that the variables are pointers rather than containers which allows the variables to be much more easily variable and do not need to be declared which is probably related to this changeability. The the code is not compiled, it is interpretted line by line which I imagine allows for more specificity at a lower level. People think that the language does not contain types because they do not need to be declared. This is not the case because the type is known directly by the attributes of the variable."
