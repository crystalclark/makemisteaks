Data Science is magic. It allows you to take a lot of data and see what is happening then share that with others. I get stuck at the "I have a lot of data" part. I get 
frustrated with the cleaning and saving and then I don't feeling confident that my data is correct and secure. Then I forget I did it and work on something else. Then I find 
it again and ask myself how am I doing this again? Why wasn't I able to get any further with it the first time? This is where I am at in my understanding at the beginning of 
this class. I hope to add to this understanding as I progress.....8/29/2020.
